Currently this app is hardcoded for a single carpool with exactly 3 users, Christian, Eric, and Sean.  Most pages are hard coded with those names.

I would like to reconstruct it, such that multiple carpools could be used.
So an Admin would create new carpoll, give it a name, create users for it.

Users would login to the app, select the carpool they are interacting with.
They can belong to more than one, and they should have a single sign on for all of them.
The credits and stats related to a carpool should remain distinct from other carpools.

The files included are app_v3.py   (uploaded)
np_Data.db
db.py
routes_acounts.py
routes_admin.py
routes_history.py
routes_today.py
templates.py
